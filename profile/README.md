## Who are we?
We are a small team of Rainbow Six: Siege modders. The team consists of:

* [Monke](https://github.com/Monke-exe) - specialized in implementations involving complex calculations.
* [Tavreth](https://github.com/Intifofo) - specialized in AI behaviour and spawning.
* [Lungu](https://github.com/Lungu19) - specialized in the FORGE file format.
* [Hound](https://github.com/houndxds) - specialized in our web based services.
* [Philip](https://github.com/Averagekurtlover) - specialized in the UI and UX of the Artemis Loader.

## What do we do?
We are currently working on our biggest project yet; The Artemis Project. The Artemis Project is a tool that will bring every found modification to the table in a single tool. It will be the best at every level, from UI and UX to efficient and easy-to-use modification implementations.

## Why do we do it?
Our end goal is to make the experience of playing old seasons of Rainbow Six: Siege as enjoyable and seamless as possible.
