## Who are we?
We are a small group of Rainbow Six: Siege modders collaborating on creating modifications to make the Rainbow Six: Siege experience more enjoyable for everyone.

## What do we do?
We are currently working on our biggest project yet; The Artemis Project. The Artemis Project is a tool that will bring every found modification to the table in a single tool. It will be the best at every level, from UI and UX to efficient and easy-to-use modification implementations.

## Why do we do it?
As previously mentioned. We want to make the experience of playing old seasons of Rainbow Six: Siege as enjoyable and seamless as possible.
